FastQC were run on the rna-seq files and the wgs-trimmed data files one by one directly in the terminal. 
The following command lines were run before starting the analyses:

module load bioinfo-tools
module load FastQC/0.11.1

Thereafter soft links for all files with raw rna-seq data and wgs-trimmed data were made one by one and put in separate folders.
The following command was used for each file:

ln -s /proj/g2021012/2_Eckalbar_2016/sel3/ 

Followed by the folder and the name of the current file.

Then fastQC were run on all rna-seq files using the following commando on each file:
fastqc -o /home/ellasj/genome_analysis/Genomeanalysis-Batwings/analyses/fastqc_raw_rna_data /home/ellasj/genome_analysis/Genomeanalysis-Batwings/data/raw_data/filename
Where filename had the name of the current file.

Then fastQC were run on all wgd files using the following commando on each file:
fastqc -o /home/ellasj/genome_analysis/Genomeanalysis-Batwings/analyses/fastqc_trimmed_wgs_data /home/ellasj/genome_analysis/Genomeanalysis-Batwings/data/trimmed_data/filename
Where filename had the name of the current file.
